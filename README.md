Steamhack
=========

## Baby's First Steampunk Roguelike ##

*"Welcome to unlimited adventure, Captain Bolte. Your ship and your crew await you."*

Steamhack is a roguelike focused on the fantasy era of industry and adventure, that time of steam technology, of airships, of swashbuckling adventurers with enormous moustaches, and so on.
You take on the role of one such man, as you adventure around randomly generated continents, cities, and tombs in search of the excitement, danger, and really wild things that you crave.
